# Saraf BRK

**Saraf BRK** is a web application designed to help North Africans living abroad send money back home easily and efficiently. Due to limited access to banks in some North African countries, we provide a solution for sending USD, EURO, and other currencies to our bank, and we handle the conversion to local currency. The recipient receives the funds via the most accessible methods available in their country, all on the same day.

## Features

- **Currency Exchange**: Send money in major currencies such as USD, EURO, and more.
- **Fast Transfers**: Same-day delivery to your recipient.
- **Secure**: Your money is transferred safely through trusted banking and transfer channels.
- **Multiple Payout Methods**: We work with local providers to ensure your recipient can receive funds in the most convenient way possible.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation to make money transfers fast and efficient.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: The web application is built with [technology/framework used for frontend].
